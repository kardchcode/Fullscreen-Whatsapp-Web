Based on the original verison by <a href="https://github.com/shreyash-b">@shreyash-b</a>, this extension aims to improve the whatsapp 
web experience by not only displaying the app content in fullscreen, but also letting the user resize the chats sidebar!<br/>
<sub>Should work on any chromium based browser (Chrome, Brave, Opera, Edge...)</sub>
